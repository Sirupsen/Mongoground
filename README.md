# Mongoground #
A simple Sinatra application using Mongo to store users, as well as retrieve them to show their usernames.

I partly adapted the Rails structure for this application, as it seemed natural to seperate the model from the "core" Sinatra file.

Oh yeah, Mongoground is "short for" Mongo Playground, both are lame names, but they suit the project.
